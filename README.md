# Problem 1

This JavaScript code snippet is creating an array called `arr` containing numbers from 1 to 10. It
then uses the `map` function along with an arrow function to square each element of the `arr` array.
The squared values are stored in a new array called `newArr`. Finally, it logs the `newArr` array to
the console, which will display the squared values of the original array elements.
