# Problem 1

This JavaScript code snippet is creating an array called `arr` containing numbers from 1 to 10. It
then uses the `map` function along with an arrow function to square each element of the `arr` array.
The squared values are stored in a new array called `newArr`. Finally, it logs the `newArr` array to
the console, which will display the squared values of the original array elements.

# Problem 2

This JavaScript code snippet is a function that takes a student's score as input, calculates the
percentage based on the total marks (assumed to be out of 600), and then determines the
corresponding grade using a series of ternary operators.

# Problem 3

This code snippet is demonstrating the use of an object in JavaScript to represent a car with
properties like name, model, and year.
